# Leaflet Challenge

This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet.js and D3.js by plotting earthquake occurrences on an interactive map. The map displays markers scaled by the earthquake magnitudes and colored based on their depths, providing a visual representation of seismic activity. Users can click on markers to see detailed information about each earthquake, and a legend explains the color coding for depth. This project showcases the integration of geographical data with interactive mapping tools.
